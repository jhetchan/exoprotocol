# ExoProtocol — Governed Repository

This repository uses ExoProtocol governance. All work must go through the session lifecycle.

## ExoProtocol Governance

- kernel: exo-kernel 0.1.0
- lock hash: `88fe490d86f8c193...`
- generated: 2026-02-14T21:39:08+08:00

### Filesystem Deny Rules

- **RULE-SEC-001**: deny read, write on `~/.aws/**`, `~/.ssh/**`, `**/.env*`
- **RULE-GIT-001**: deny read, write, delete on `.git/**`
- **RULE-KRN-001**: deny write, delete on `exo/kernel/**`
- **RULE-DEL-001**: deny delete on `src/**`

### Structural Rules

- **RULE-LOCK-001** (require_lock): Blocked by RULE-LOCK-001 (acquire a ticket lock first).
- **RULE-CHECK-001** (require_checks): Blocked by RULE-CHECK-001 (checks must pass before done).
- **RULE-EVO-001** (evolution_gate): Practice is mutable, governance requires explicit human approval.
- **RULE-EVO-002** (patch_first): Patch-first evolution required.

### Default Budgets

- max files changed: 12
- max LOC changed: 400

### Approved Checks

- `npm test`
- `npm run lint`
- `pytest`
- `python -m pytest`
- `python3 -m compileall exo`
- `python3 -m pytest`

### Source of Truth

The values above are a **snapshot** generated from the governance manifest.

Manifest paths:
- `.exo/config.yaml` — budgets, checks allowlist, scheduler config
- `.exo/governance.lock.json` — compiled rules, deny patterns, source hash

### Test-Driven, Manifest-First Workflow

This principle applies to **all code you write** — governance and application logic alike.

1. **Config/contract is the source of truth.** When a value is defined in a config file,
   schema, manifest, or contract — code must load it from that source at runtime.
   Never copy a value from a config file and paste it as a literal in source code.
2. **Tests verify the wiring, not the value.** Tests must assert that code reads from
   the config/contract, not that it produces a specific hardcoded result.
   A test that passes when you swap the config value *and* swap the assertion is useless —
   it only proves both sides were copy-pasted from the same place.
3. **If you can change a config value and no test breaks, the test is missing.**
   Every configurable value should have at least one test that will vary the input
   and verify the output follows.

Examples:
- **BAD**: `assert budget == 10` (hardcoded, passes even if config is ignored)
- **GOOD**: set config to 42, assert output contains 42 and not the old default
- **BAD**: `MAX_RETRIES = 3` (literal in source when retries is in config)
- **GOOD**: `max_retries = load_config()['max_retries']`

### Operational Learnings

When you discover a reusable pattern, gotcha, or operational insight during a session:
- Record it with `exo reflect` (CLI) or `exo_reflect` (MCP) — NOT your private memory
- ExoProtocol reflections are injected into future session bootstraps for all agents
- Private memory files (MEMORY.md, .cursorrules, etc.) are agent-specific and invisible to the team
- If you must write to private memory, also create an ExoProtocol reflection with the same insight

**Private memory monitoring**: If `private_memory.watch_paths` in `.exo/config.yaml` is empty,
add the absolute path to your memory file (e.g., `~/.claude/.../memory/MEMORY.md`) so that
ExoProtocol can detect when you write to private memory without creating a shared reflection.

### End-of-Work Reflection

When you complete significant work or the user appears to be wrapping up:
- **Proactively** run `exo reflect --pattern '<what kept happening>' --insight '<what was learned>'`
  for each non-trivial insight discovered during the conversation
- Do NOT wait for `session-finish` — many users close the editor without explicit session end
- Good reflection triggers: bug fixes, CI failures, gotchas, architectural decisions, workflow improvements

## Session Lifecycle

Before starting any work:

1. **Start session**: `EXO_ACTOR=agent:claude python3 -m exo.cli session-start --ticket-id <TICKET> --vendor anthropic --model <MODEL> --task "<TASK>"`
2. **Read bootstrap**: Open `.exo/cache/sessions/agent-claude.bootstrap.md` and follow its directives
3. **Execute work** within ticket scope
4. **Finish session**: `EXO_ACTOR=agent:claude python3 -m exo.cli session-finish --ticket-id <TICKET> --summary "<SUMMARY>" --set-status review`

## Non-Negotiables

- Do NOT start work without an active session (`session-start`)
- Do NOT close without a session finish (`session-finish`)
- Respect ticket scope: only modify files allowed by the ticket's `scope.allow` / `scope.deny`
- If checks fail at finish, fix them — do not use `--skip-check` without `--break-glass-reason`
- The bootstrap file is your source of truth for the current session
- Never hardcode values that belong in config — load from manifest at runtime, write tests that vary the config
- Read `.exo/LEARNINGS.md` for operational learnings from prior sessions
